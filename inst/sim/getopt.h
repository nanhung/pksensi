/* Index in ARGV of the next element to be scanned.
   This is used for communication to and from the caller
   and for communication between successive calls to `_getopt'.

   On entry to `_getopt', zero means this is the first call; initialize.

   When `_getopt' returns EOF, this is the index of the first of the
   non-option elements that the caller should itself scan.

   Otherwise, `optind' communicates from one call to the next
   how much of ARGV has been scanned so far.  */

   for unrecognized options.  */

/* Describe the long-named options requested by the application.
   The LONG_OPTIONS argument to _getopt_long or _getopt_long_only is a vector
   of `struct option' terminated by an element containing a name which is
   zero.

   The field `has_arg' is:
   no_argument		(or 0) if the option does not take an argument,
   required_argument	(or 1) if the option requires an argument,
   optional_argument 	(or 2) if the option takes an optional argument.

   If the field `flag' is not NULL, it points to a variable that is set
   to the value given in the field `val' when the option is found, but
   left unchanged if the option is not found.

   To have a long-named option do something other than set an `int' to
   a compiled-in constant, such as set a value from `optarg', set the
   option's `flag' field to zero and its `val' field to a nonzero
   value (the equivalent single-letter option character, if there is
   one).  For long options that have a zero `flag' field, `_getopt'
   returns the contents of the `val' field.  */
