Description: Applying the global sensitivity analysis workflow to investigate the parameter uncertainty and sensitivity in physiologically based kinetic (PK) models, especially the physiologically based pharmacokinetic/toxicokinetic model with multivariate outputs. The package also provides some functions to check the convergence and sensitivity of model parameters.
