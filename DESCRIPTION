Description: Applying the global sensitivity analysis workflow to investigate 
    the parameter uncertainty and sensitivity in physiologically based 
    kinetic (PK) models, especially the physiologically based 
    pharmacokinetic/toxicokinetic model with multivariate outputs. 
    The package also provides some functions to check the convergence 
    and sensitivity of model parameters. The workflow was first mentioned 
    in Hsieh et al., (2018) <doi:10.3389/fphar.2018.00588>, then further 
    refined (Hsieh et al., 2020 <doi:10.1016/j.softx.2020.100609>).
